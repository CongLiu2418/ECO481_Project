The stock market has always been difficult to predict due to the complex behaviour and volatility within the market. In the past, investors have tended to use their subjective judgments to buy and sell stocks, but some have come to a loss. 
In the age of the technological revolution, embracing artificial intelligence in the financial market is the next frontier for investors, firms, and stockholders. Combining the financial and technical domains will allow firms to exploit specific trading opportunities through calculated decisions on expected values of earnings and losses.
These ideas fascinated our group and established our interest in determining how we could blend both domains to base these solutions. The COVID-19 pandemic hit the world unpredictably. Under this shock, we are interested in comparing different machine learning models and evaluating whether their prediction performance is still robust. The research question we plan to investigate is: which machine learning model is the best at predicting stock market direction during the COVID-19 pandemic?
